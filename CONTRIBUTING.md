# Contributing to the PerfView repository
test
First and foremost, we want to thank you for your willingness to help make PerfView better.
Here we describe a bunch of rules / advice associated with doing so. You may end up 
getting frustrated with the process. This guide is our attempt to keep that frustration
as low as possible.   

The simple truth is that not all change is good (big surprise), and because of this, we reserve 
the right to reject any pull request to this repo. We wonâ€™t do this without rationale, and 
our rationale is simple at its heart.

1. Complexity is bad. Changes that add complexity need more careful deliberation 
to weigh the bad against the good that comes along with it. 

2. Consistency is good. Bugs are basically a kind of inconsistency (the program does 
not work as a simple understanding would assume). There are, of course, feature additions
that make consistency better, but it is all too easy for new features to NOT be consistent
with existing features. 

3. In addition to the benefit of the new behavior, you must also carefully consider
cost to any scenario that is being penalized (e.g. make it slower or more complex,
change its UI, or take away functionality).  

And our golden rule 

*  **When in doubt, ask us by posting an issue or suggestion**

The key here is that from your point of view the new feature you are adding looks like unalloyed 
good.  But it is very likely that it increases complexity (point 1), may affect consistency (point 2) 
and may make other scenarios slower (e.g. startup, etc.) (point 3).   As the keepers of this repo we 
have the responsibility to weigh these other factors, and we may decide that the bad outweighs
the good.

A rejected pull request is a failure for the repo as a whole because it means that multiple people 
spent time on things that ultimately did not benefit the repo. We want to avoid that. There 
is a simple heuristic that helps:

* **The bigger the change, the more 'pre-vetting' you need**

Thus what we DON'T what you to do is over the course of time build up a rather massive change
and then as some point decide to submit it as a pull request. The likelihood of this landing
in a good place is next to nil.    

Small bug fixes / features that do not add interesting complexity are easy, just do them and 
submit the pull request.   Bigger bug fixes should be vetted by asking first. Code 
reorganization is particularly tricky.  By (1) and (2) we like this assuming it lowers overall
complexity and improves consistency, but it is very disruptive and ideally is done in a series
of small steps. Thus planning is needed, and you should talk with us by posting the issue.   

In general all features need pre-vetting.   The rule here is simple.  Don't do any work unless
you:

1. Are willing to throw it away (e.g. it was more effort to get it vetted) OR
2. You have vetted it with us by creating an issue, and got positive confirmation from the 
   discussion that you are on the right track. If it is a big change, you should stay updated with ongoing
   discussion on the issue to insure that you stay on track.   

Performance improvements are often a point of contention.   Improvements that make the code
smaller / simpler are great, but often this is not the case. If you are adding complexity as
part of your improvement (e.g. adding a cache), again, you have to follow the rule above
and get it pre-vetted, or be willing to abandon the change.   For performance changes in
general we will probably ask you to take measurements to quantify exactly how much improvement
there was. There is more work than just modifying the code. 

## Coding Standards

See [PerfView Coding Standards](documentation/CodingStandards.md). 

## Testing and Contributing tests

There are a number of *.Test projects that are unit tests that need to be run before checking in.
You can run these tests in Visual Studio by selecting the Test -> Run -> All Tests menu entry.
These tests need to be run on the DEBUG configuration (that is with asserts) for them to 
have really good effectiveness (the code has lots of asserts).   

The tests should run in less than 1 minute total.
