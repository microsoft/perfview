    // #Introduction
    // 
    // Sadly, System.Runtime.Serialization has a serious performance flaw. In the scheme created there, the
    // basic contract between an object and the serializer is fundamentally heavy. For serialization the
    // contract is for the object to implement System.Runtime.Serialization.ISerializable.GetObjectData
    // and this should a series of AddValue() APIs on System.Runtime.Serialization.SerializationInfo
    // which are given field names and values. The AddValue APIs box the values and place them in a table, It
    // is then the serializers job to actually send out the bits given this table. The REQUIRED work of
    // serializing an integers copying 4 bytes to some output buffer (a few instructions), however the
    // protocol above requires 1000s.
    // 
    // The classes in Serialize.cs are an attempt to create really light weight serialization. At the heart
    // of the design are two interfaces IStreamReader and IStreamWriter. They are a simplified
    // INTERFACE much like System.IO.BinaryReader and System.IO.BinaryWriter, that know how to
    // write only the most common data types (integers and strings). They also fundamentally understand that
    // they are a stream of bytes, and thus have the concept of StreamLabel which is a 'pointer' to a
    // spot in the stream. This is critically important as it allows the serialized form to create a
    // complicated graph of objects in the stream. While IStreamWriter does not have the ability to seek,
    // the IStreamReader does (using StreamLabel), because it is expected that the reader will want
    // to follow StreamLabel 'pointers' to traverse the serialized data in a more random access way.
    // 
    // However, in general, an object needs more than a MemoryStreamWriter to serialize itself. When an object
    // graph could have cycles, it needs a way of remembering which objects it has already serialized. It
    // also needs a way encoding types, because in general the type of an object cannot always be inferred
    // from its context. This is the job of the Serializer class. A Serializer holds all the state
    // needed to represent a partially serialized object graph, but the most important part of a
    // Serializer is its Serializer.writer property, which holds the logical output stream.
    // 
    // Similarly a Deserializer holds all the 'in flight' information needed to deserialize a complete
    // object graph, and its most important property is its Deserializer.reader that holds the logical
    // input stream.
    // 
    // An object becomes serializable by doing two things
    //     * implementing the IFastSerializable interface and implementing the
    //         IFastSerializable.ToStream and IFastSerializable.FromStream methods.
    //     * implementing a public constructor with no arguments (default constructor). This is needed because
    //         an object needs to be created before IFastSerializable.FromStream can be called.
    // 
    // The IFastSerializable.ToStream method that the object implements is passed a Serializer, and
    // the object is free to take advantage of all the facilities (like its serialized object table) to help
    // serialize itself, however at its heart, the ToStream method tends to fetch the Serialier.writer
    // and write out the primitive fields in order. Similarly at the heart of the
    // IFastSerializable.FromStream method is fetching the Deserializer.reader and reading in a
    // series of primitive types.
    // 
    // Now the basic overhead of serializing a object in the common case is
    // 
    //     * A interface call to IFastSerializable.ToStream.
    //     * A fetch of IStreamWriter from the Serialier.writer field
    //     * a series of IStreamWriter.Write operations which is an interface call, plus the logic to
    //         store the actual data to the stream (the real work).
    //         
    // This is MUCH leaner, and now dominated by actual work of copying the data to the output buffer.

    /// Goals:
    ///     * Allows full range of serialization, including subclassing and cyclic object graphs.
    ///     * Can be serialized and deserialized efficiently sequentially (no seeks MANDATED on read or

    ///     * Pay for play (thus very efficient in simple cases (no subclassing or cyclic graphs).
    ///     * Ideally self-describing, and debuggable (output as XML if desired?)

    /// Versioning:
    ///     * We want the ability for new formats to accept old versions if objects wish to support old
    ///         formats
    ///     * Also wish to allow new formats to be read by OLD version if the new format is just an
    ///         'extension' (data added to end of objects). This makes making new versions almost pain-free.
    ///         
    /// Concepts:
    ///     * No-seek requirement
    ///     
    ///         The serialized form should be such that it can be deserialized efficiently in a serial fashion
    ///         (no seeks). This means all information needed to deserialize has to be 'just in time' (can't
    ///         be some table at the end). Pragmatically this means that type information (needed to create
    ///         instances), has to be output on first use, so it is available for the deserializer.
    ///         
    ///     * Laziness requirement
    ///     
    ///         While is should be possible to read the serialized for sequentially, we should also not force
    ///         it. It should be possible to have a large file that represents a persisted structure that can
    ///         be lazily brought into memory on demand. This means that all information needed to
    ///         deserialize must also be 'randomly available' and not depend on reading from the beginning.
    ///         Pragmatically this means that type information, and forward forwardReference information needs to
    ///         have a table in a well known Location at the end so that it can be found without having to
    ///         search the file sequentially.
    ///     
    ///     * Versioning requirement
    ///         
    ///         To allow OLD code to access NEW formats, it must be the case that the serialized form of
    ///         every instance knows how to 'skip' past any new data (even if it does not know its exact
    ///         size). To support this, objects have 'begin' and 'end' tags, which allows the deserializer to
    ///         skip the next object.
    ///         
    ///     * Polymorphism requirement
    ///     
    ///         Because the user of a filed may not know the exact instance stored there, in general objects
    ///         need to store the exact type of the instance. Thus they need to store a type identifier, this
    ///         can be folded into the 'begin' tag.
    ///         
    ///     * Arbitrary object graph (circularity) requirement (Forward references)
    ///     
    ///         The serializer needs to be able to serialize arbitrary object graphs, including those with
    ///         cycles in them. While you can do this without forward references, the system is more flexible
    ///         if it has the concept of a forward reference. Thus whenever a object reference is required, a
    ///         'forward forwardReference' can be given instead. What gets serialized is simply an unique forward
    ///         reference index (index into an array), and at some later time that index is given its true
    ///         value. This can either happen with the target object is serialized (see

    ///         tell the serializer what data to store for an individual instance. However this core is not
    ///         enough. An object that implements IFastSerializable must also implement a default
    ///         constructor (constructor with no args), so that that deserializer can create the object (and
