/* README FIRST */
// Many operations can be done by streaming over the raw events in time order.   However more sophisticated analysis
// requires information from multiple events to be correlated and collated to be useful.   Chief among these are 
// stack traces (because for at least kernel stack traces, stacks come as two events (one for the kernel part and
// one for the user mode part), that are separated in time (and even separated from the event that triggered the stack
// trace.  In addition stacks requires that information about module loading and JIT compilation (for .NET or JScript) 
// also be incorporated.
//
// A useful way of accomplishing this is to convert the raw ETL file to a augmented ETLX file format.   This translation
// can keep all the original information from the ETL file but it can rearrange it so that it is 'digested' so that information
// is stored for easy retrieval instead of easy generation (which is what the ETL file format was optimized for).
//
// The programmatic interface to this ETLX file format is the 'TraceLog' class.   You convert an ETL file to an ETLX file
// using the 'TraceLog.CreateFromETL() API, and once you have an ETLX file,  you can open it with the TraceLog(string) 
// constructor.
//
// Like an ETL file an ETLX file does allow you scan all the events in the file in time order using callbacks, but it
// can do so much more including
//
//  * Detailed summary information is available without need to scan all the events.  Summary information include
//         * TraceProcess - for each process in the trace for any amount of time, its start time, stop time, command line, ...)
//         * TraceThread - For each process, the threads that ever existed in the process
//         * TraceLoadedModule - For each process all the DLLs it ever loaded, including how much CPU time is spent in each
//         * TraceCounts - For each event, how many times the event occurs in the trace, and whether it has stacks associated with it
// 
//  * Much better navigation capabilities
//         * IEnumerables on the events (rather than the callback model)
//         * Easy and efficient filtering by time range (random access), process or by event type. 
//         * Ability to iterate backwards 
//
//  * All items have dense (array) indexes
//         * All the items in the ETLX file have indexes associated with them.  This means that you can create 'side arrays'
//           of this size and thus 'attach' your own information to these things.   All of the items have ways of looking
//           up the item by this index, which means you can also 'remember' particular items (typically Events, but also
//           stacks, code addresses, processes or modules) in your own data structures.    This solves many otherwise ugly
//           problems (for example a OS process ID is NOT unique if the process dies, thus in a trace a process ID is NOT
//           a unique identifier, but a TraceLog ProcessIndex IS a unique identifier for any process in the trace.  
//
//  * Stack support.   ETW supports generating call stacks along with particular events.   This information in its raw form
//       is a list of return address locations.   TraceLog has logic to translate these addresses into TraceCodeAddresses
//       which represent a particular locations (methods and line numbers) in particular DLLs.  It handles all the 
//       complexity of decoding these addresses and looking up both managed (JIT compiled) and native (PDB lookup).   
//         * TraceCallStack - for every stack trace, the list of code addresses in the stack.  
//         * TraceCodeAddress - for every instruction pointer in the trace, the module or JIT compiled method associated with it.
// 
// In this demo, like the SimpleEVetnSourceFile we generate some EventSource events to a file.   However we also turn on
// stack logging for these events.   We also cause some C# exceptions during data collection.   Then we use TraceLog to 
// print the stack traces for these events and the stack associated with them.
