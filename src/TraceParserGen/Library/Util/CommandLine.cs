// See code:#Overview to get started.
/// <summary>
/// #Overview
/// 
/// The code:CommandLineParser is a utility for parsing command lines. Command lines consist of three basic
/// entities. A command can have any (or none) of the following (separated by whitespace of any size).
/// 
///    * PARAMETERS - this are non-space strings. They are positional (logicaly they are numbered). Strings
///        with space can be specified by enclosing in double quotes.
///        
///    * QUALIFERS - Qualifiers are name-value pairs. The following syntax is supported.
///        * -QUALIFER
///        * -QUALIFER:VALUE
///        * -QUALIFER=VALUE
///        * -QUALIFER VALUE
///        
///      The end of a value is delimited by space. Again values with spaces can be encoded by enclosing them
///      the value (or the whole qualifer-value string), in double quotes. The first form (where a value is
///      not specified is only available for boolean qualifers, and boolean values can not use the form where
///      the qualifer and value are separated by space. The '/' character can also be used instead of the '-'
///      to begin a qualifier.
///      
///      Unlike parameters, qualifers are NOT ordered. They may occur in any order with respect to the
///      parameters or other qualifers and THAT ORDER IS NOT COMMUNICATED THROUGH THE PARSER. Thus it is not
///      possible to have qualifers that only apply to specific parameters.
///      
///    * PARAMETER SET SPECIFIER - A parameter set is optional argument that looks like a boolean qualifier
///        (however if NoDashOnParameterSets is set the dash is not need, so it is looks like a parameter),
///        that is special in that it decides what qualifers and positional parameters are allowed. See
///        code:#ParameterSets for more
///        
/// #ParameterSets
/// 
/// Parameter sets are an OPTIONAL facility of code:CommandLineParser that allow more complex command lines
/// to be specified accurately. It not uncommon for a EXE to have several 'commands' that are logically
/// independent of one another. For example a for example For example a program might have 'checkin'
/// 'checkout' 'list' commands, and each of these commands has a different set of parameters that are needed
/// and qualifers that are allowed. (for example checkout will take a list of file names, list needs nothing,
/// and checkin needs a comment). Additionally some qualifers (like say -dataBaseName can apply to any of hte
/// commands). Thus You would like to say that the following command lines are legal
/// 
///     * EXE -checkout MyFile1 MyFile -dataBaseName:MyDatabase
///     * EXE -dataBaseName:MyDatabase -list
///     * EXE -comment "Specifying the comment first" -checkin
///     * EXE -checkin -comment "Specifying the comment afterward"
/// 
/// But the following are not
/// 
///     * EXE -checkout
///     * EXE -checkout -comment "hello"
///     * EXE -list MyFile
/// 
/// You do this by specifying 'checkout', 'list' and 'checkin' as paramters sets. On the command line they
/// look like boolean qualifers, however they have additional sematantics. They must come before any
/// positional parameters (because they affect whether the parameters are allowed and what they are named),
/// and they are mutually exclusive. Each parameter set gets its own set of parameter definitions, and
/// qualifilers can either be associated with a particular parameter set (like -comment) or global to all
/// parameter sets (like -dataBaseName) .
/// 
/// By default parameter set specifiers look like a boolean specifier (begin with a '-' or '/'), however
/// because it is common practice to NOT have a dash for commands, there there is a Property
/// code:CommandLineParser.NoDashOnParameterSets that indicates that the dash is not used. If this was
/// specified then the following command would be legal.
/// 
///     * EXE checkout MyFile1 MyFile -dataBaseName:MyDatabase
/// 
/// #DefaultParameterSet
/// 
/// One parameters set (which has the empty string name), is special in that it is used when no other
/// parmeter set is matched. This is the default parameter set. For example, if -checkout was defined to be
/// the default parameter set, then the following would be legal.
/// 
///     * EXE Myfile1 Myfile
/// 
/// And would implicitly mean 'checkout' Myfile1, Myfile2
/// 
/// If no parameter sets are defined, then all qualifiers and paramters are in the default parameter set.
/// 
/// -------------------------------------------------------------------------
/// #Syntatic ambiguities
/// 
/// Because whitespace can separate a qualifier from its value AND Qualifier from each other, and because
/// parameter values might start with a dash (and thus look like qualifers), the syntax is ambiguous. It is
/// disambigutated with the following rules.
///     * The command line is parsed into 'arguments' that are spearated by whitespace. Any string enclosed
///         in "" will be a single argument even if it has embedded whitespace. Double quote characters can
///         be specified by \" (and a \" literal can be specified by \\" etc).
///     * Arguments are parsed into qualifiers. This parsing stops if a '--' argument is found. Thus all
///         qualifers must come before any '--' argument but parameters that begin with - can be specified by
///         placing them after the '--' argument,
///     * Qualifers are parsed. Because spaces can be used to separate a qualifer from its value, the type of
///         the qualifer must be known to parse it. Boolean values never consume an additional parameter, and
///         non-boolean qualifiers ALWAYS consume the next argument (if there is no : or =). If the empty
///         string is to be specified, it must use the ':' or '=' form. Moreover it is illegal for the values
///         that begin with '-' to use space as a separator. They must instead use the ':' or '=' form. This
///         is because it is too confusing for humans to parse (values look like qualifiers).
///      * Parameters are parsed. Whatever arguments that were not used by qualifers are parameters.
/// 
/// --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
/// #DefiningParametersAndQualifiers
/// 
/// The following example shows the steps for defining the parameters and qualifers for the example. Note
/// that the order is important. Qualifers that apply to all commands must be specified first, then each
/// parameter set then finally the default parameter set. Most steps are optional.
///
///     class CommandLineParserExample1
///     {
///         enum Command { checkout, checkin, list };
///         static void Main()
///         {
///             string dataBaseName = "myDefaultDataBase";
///             string comment = "";
///             Command command = checkout;
///             string[] fileNames = null;
///
///             // Step 1 define the parser. 
///             CommandLineParser commandLineParser = new CommandLineParser();      // by default uses Environment.CommandLine
///
///             // Step 2 (optional) define qualifiers that apply to all parameter sets. 
///             commandLineParser.DefineOptionalParameter("dataBaseName", ref dataBaseName, "Help for database.");
///
///             // Step 3A define the checkin command this includes all parameters and qualifers specific to this command
///             commandLineParser.DefineParameterSet("checkin", ref command, Command.checkin, "Help for checkin.");
///             commandLineParser.DefineOptionalQualifers("comment", ref comment, "Help for -comment.");
///
///             // Step 3B define the list command this includes all parameters and qualifers specific to this command
///             commandLineParser.DefineParameterSet("list", ref command, Command.list, "Help for list.");
///
///             // Step 4 (optional) define the default parameter set (in this case checkout). 
///             commandLineParser.DefineDefaultParameterSet("checkout", ref command, Command.checkout, "Help for checkout.");
///             commandLineParser.DefineParamter("fileNames", ref fileNames, "Help for fileNames.");
///
///             // Step 5, do final validation (look for undefined qualifiers, extra parameters ...
///             commandLineParser.CompleteValidation();
///
///             // Step 6 use the parsed values
///             Console.WriteLine("Got {0} {1} {2} {3} {4}", dataBaseName, command, comment, string.Join(',', fileNames));
///         }
///     }
///
/// #RequiredAndOptional
/// 
/// Parameters and qualifiers can be specified as required (the default), or optional. Makeing the default
/// required was choses to make any mistakes 'obvious' since the parser will fail if a required parameter is
/// not present (if the default was optional, it would be easy to make what should have been a required
/// qualifer optional, leading to business logic failiure).
/// 
/// #ParsedValues
/// 
/// The class was designed maximize programmer convinience. For each parameter, only one call is needed to
/// both define the parameter, its help message, and retrive its (strong typed) value. For example
/// 
///      * int count = 5;
///      * parser.DefineOptionalQualifer("count", ref count, "help for optional debugs qualifer");
/// 
/// Defines a qualifer 'count' and will place its value in the local variable 'count' as a integer. Default
/// values are supported by doing nothing, so in the example above the default value will be 5.
/// 
/// Types supported: The parser will support any type that has a static method called 'Parse' taking one
/// string argument and returning that type. This is true for all primtive types, DateTime, Enumerations, and
/// any user defined type that follows this convention.
/// 
/// Array types: The parser has special knowedge of arrays. If the type of a qualifer is an array, then the
/// string value is assumed to be a ',' separated list of strings which will be parsed as the element type of
/// the array. In addition to the ',' syntax, it is also legal to specify the qualifer more than once. For
/// example given the defintion
/// 
///      * int[] counts;
///      * parser.DefineOptionalQualifer("counts", ref counts, "help for optional counts qualifier");
///      
/// The command line
/// 
///     * EXE -counts 5 SomeArg -counts 6 -counts:7
/// 
/// Is the same as
/// 
///     * EXE -counts:5,6,7 SomeArg
///      
/// If a qualifier or parameter is an array type and is required, then the array must have at least one
/// element. If it is optional, then the array can be empty (but in all cases, the array is created, thus
/// null is never returned by the command line parser).
/// 
/// By default is it is illegal for a non-array qualifer to be specified more than once. It is however
/// possible to override this behavior by setting the LastQualiferWins property before defining the qualifer.
/// 
/// -------------------------------------------------------------------------
/// #Misc
/// 
/// Qualifier can have more than one string form (typically a long and a short form). These are specified
/// with the code:DefineAliases method.
/// 
/// After defining all the qualifers and parameters, it is necessary to call the parser to check for the user
/// specifying a qualifer (or parameter) that does not exist. This is the purpose of the
/// code:CompleteValidation method.
/// 
/// When an error is detected at runtime an instance of code:CommandLineParserException is thrown. The error
/// message in this exception was designed to be suitable to print to the user directly.
/// 
/// #CommandLineHelp
/// 
/// The parser also can generate help that is correct for the qualifer and parameter definitions. This can be
/// accessed from the code:CommandLineParser.GetHelp method. It is also possible to get the help for just a
/// particular Parameter set with code:CommandLineParser.GetHelpForParameterSet. This help includes command
/// line syntax, whether the qualifer or parameter is optional or a list, the types of the qualifers and
/// parameters, the help text, and default values.   The help text comes from the 'Define' Methods, and is
/// properly word-wrapped.  Newlines in the help text indicate new paragraphs.   
/// 
/// #AutomaticExceptionProcessingAndHelp
/// 
/// In the CommandLineParserExample1, while the command line parser did alot of the work there is still work
/// needed to make the application user friendly that pretty much all applications need. These include
///  
///     * Call the code:CommandLineParser constructor and code:CommandLineParser.CompleteValidation
///     * Catch any code:CommandLineParserException and print a friendly message
///     * Define a -? qualifer and wire it up to print the help.
/// 
/// Since this is stuff that all applications will likely need the
/// code:CommandLineParser.ParseForConsoleApplication was created to do all of this for you, thus making it
/// super-easy to make a production quality parser (and concentrate on getting your application logic instead
/// of command line parsing. Here is an example which defines a 'Ping' command. If you will notice there are
/// very few lines of code that are not expressing something very specific to this applications. This is how
/// it should be!
///
///     class CommandLineParserExample2
///     {
///         static void Main()
///         {
///             CommandLineParser.ParseForConsoleApplication(delegate(CommandLineParser commandLineParser)
///             {
///                 // Step 1: Initialize to the defaults
///                 string Host = null;       
///                 int Timeout = 1000;
///                 bool Forever = false;
///
///                 // Step 2: Define the paramters, in this case there is only the default parameter set. 
///                 CommandLineParser.ParseForConsoleApplication(args, delegate(CommandLineParser parser)
///                 {
///                     parser.DefineOptionalQualifier("Timeout", ref Timeout, "Timeout in milliseconds to wait for each reply.");
///                     parser.DefineOptionalQualifier("Forever", ref Forever, "Ping forever.");
///                     parser.DefineDefaultParameterSet("Ping sends a network request to a host to reply to the message (to check for liveness).");
///                     parser.DefineParameter("Host", ref Host, "The Host to send a ping message to.");
///                 });
///
///                 // Step 3, use the parameters

///             });
///         }
///     }
///
/// Using local variables for the parsed arguments if fine when the program is not complex and the values
/// don't need to be passed around to many routines.  In general, however it is often a better idea to
