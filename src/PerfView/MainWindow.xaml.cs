// Add PreStub Event (useful for working set regression)
// Add Class loaded Event (useful for working set regressions)

/* .NET Runtime (/
// Make Allocation Tick variable.

// Review and insure that we don't have any CLRStacks on any events that don't need them.  
// PinObjectAtGCTime and FinalizeObject seem to have a non-trivial impact in some scenarios.    Both should NOT have stacks!

// * When exceptions happen they get swallowed!
// * Remove the limit on the number of strings

// Can we get Tofino on board (what about VS, as a plugin?)
// Get Powershell consumption.  
// Solve the lost manifest problem (circular buffer with process that dies).  (Rundown at process shutdown?)
// Diagnostic mode in EventSource.  
// Think about versioning of eventSources (return nulls if you are off the end of an event)
// Make EventSource parsing work with multiple versions (basically don't go off the end of the buffer).

// Localization bug Windows 102699  
//          Hi, In PerfView you can select cells in the data view and it will sum up the values in the bottom of the window. Problem is, it converts the numbers for displaying using American culture (eg. 1,234.56), while the sum functionality interprets the formatted numbers using the local culture (in my case danish: 1.234,56). I took a screenshot: imgur.com/GbYEL The values selected are 95 and 2.9 and they get summed up to 979. Similarly, when I select 4717 and 142 they get summed up to 146.717. I also found the same problem in the event window. If you select a time cell in the data view and right click -> Open Any Stacks, you will get a CPU stack window where the start and end time has been set to the wrong number. Example: I select the time 319.879 and when the cpu stack window opens, it's empty and the start and end time has been set to 319879. This is again because the data view doesn't use the local culture, while everything else does.
