/* Master TODO list */
// ****** LARGER ISSUES  ********
// Better JSON support.
// Better control of static variable in C#
// Add PreStub Event (useful for working set regression)
// Add Class loaded Event (useful for working set regressions)

/* .NET Runtime (/
// Make Allocation Tick variable.
// JitStarted Info level (not verbose)
// Consolidate the GCRange events into one event
// Ensure that we don't have 2 GC Start events (Or others...)
// Allow ClrStress to pay attention to level and keyword.
// GC allocation stacks should work without process restart.
// Keyword if you only care about large objects.
// Guarantee that every large object gets an event.
// Review and ensure that we don't have any CLRStacks on any events that don't need them.
// PinObjectAtGCTime and FinalizeObject seem to have a non-trivial impact in some scenarios.    Both should NOT have stacks!

// The efficiency of stopwatch can be improved (at least review).
// DateTime.Now should be more efficient (cache timeZone, should not allocate)

/******* EVENTSOURCE ********/
// Make it an error if you use implicit event numbering after using explicit numbering

// Add the per-listener logic for filtering (a filter delegate you can register).
// The EventSource to EventListener path is now pretty poor (goes through encode - decode logic).
// * When exceptions happen they get swallowed!
// * Remove the limit on the number of strings
// * allow blob support.
// If you don't make Tasks public the error is very tricky
// Strings with embedded nulls fail.
// Get Powershell on the EventSource plan
// In particular in the short term.
// Don't like the keyword 0 semantics
// Make doing start and stop easy
// Can we get Tofino on board (what about VS, as a plugin?)
// Get Powershell consumption.
// Solve the lost manifest problem (circular buffer with process that dies).  (Rundown at process shutdown?)
// Diagnostic mode in EventSource.
// Think about versioning of eventSources (return nulls if you are off the end of an event)
// Make EventSource parsing work with multiple versions (basically don't go off the end of the buffer).

/* EXTERNAL REPORTS */
// Localization bug Windows 102699
//          Hi, In PerfView you can select cells in the data view and it will sum up the values in the bottom of the window. Problem is, it converts the numbers for displaying using American culture (eg. 1,234.56), while the sum functionality interprets the formatted numbers using the local culture (in my case danish: 1.234,56). I took a screenshot: imgur.com/GbYEL The values selected are 95 and 2.9 and they get summed up to 979. Similarly, when I select 4717 and 142 they get summed up to 146.717. I also found the same problem in the event window. If you select a time cell in the data view and right click -> Open Any Stacks, you will get a CPU stack window where the start and end time has been set to the wrong number. Example: I select the time 319.879 and when the cpu stack window opens, it's empty and the start and end time has been set to 319879. This is again because the data view doesn't use the local culture, while everything else does.
