            Clean is sort of a 'safe' recursive delete of a directory.  It either deletes the
            files or moves them to '*.deleting' names.  It deletes directories that are completely
            empty.  Thus it will do a recursive delete when that is possible.  There will only 
            be *.deleting files after this returns.  It returns the number of files and directories
            that could not be deleted.

             DirectoryUtilities.GetFiles is basicaly the same as Directory.GetFiles 
             however it returns IEnumerator, which means that it lazy.  This is very important 
             for large directory trees.  A searchPattern can be specified (Windows wildcard conventions)
             that can be used to filter the set of archiveFile names returned.

            AwaitUnblocks is a specialized form of the 'Start' event that fires when a task starts because

            event has been delivered.    
            
            Not every AWAIT end causes a callback.  Because an AWAIT begin happens for every FRAME you only
            want a callback for the FIRST task (activity) created by parent of this activity.  This is what
            this callback does.  
            
            AwaitUnblocks are often treated differently because you want to consider the time between the begin 
            (Activity Created) and awaitUnbock to be accounted for as on the critical path, whereas for 'normal' 
            tasks you normally don't think that time is interesting.

             Approximations we do in this function for V4_5 and prior:
             On 4.0 we didn't seperate free list from free obj, so we just use fragmentation (which is the sum)
             as an approximation. This makes the efficiency value a bit larger than it actually is.
             We don't actually update in for the older gen - this means we only know the out for the younger 
             gen which isn't necessarily all allocated into the older gen. So we could see cases where the 
             out is > 0, yet the older gen's free list doesn't change. Using the younger gen's out as an 
             approximation makes the efficiency value larger than it actually is.
            
             For V4_6 this requires no approximation.

            Sadly, with AWAIT nodes might come into existance AFTER we would have normally identified 
            a region as having no thread/await working on it.  Thus you have to be able to 'undo' ASYNC_UNKONWN
            nodes.   We solve this by remembering all of our ASYNC_UNKNOWN nodes on a list (basically provisional)
            and only add them when the start-stop activity dies (when we know there can't be another AWAIT.  
            Note that we only care about TOP-MOST activities.

            ETWReloggerTraceEventSource is designed to be able to write ETW files using an existing ETW input stream (either a file, files or real time session) as a basis.

            can be used to either copy events from the event stream (the common case), or inject new events (high level stats).

            Kernel traces have information about images that are loaded, however they don't have enough information
            in the events themselves to unambigously look up PDBs without looking at the data inside the images.
            This means that symbols can't be resolved unless you are on the same machine on which you gathered the data.
            
            XPERF solves this problem by adding new 'synthetic' events that it creates by looking at the trace and then
            opening each DLL mentioned and extracting the information needed to look PDBS up on a symbol server (this 
            includes the PE file's TimeDateStamp as well as a PDB Guid, and 'pdbAge' that can be found in the DLLs header.
            
            These new events are added when XPERF runs the 'merge' command (or -d flag is passed).  It is also exposed 
            through the KernelTraceControl.dll!CreateMergedTraceFile API.

            This timestamp is used to be as the 'signature' of the image and is used as a key to find the symbols, however 
            this has mostly be superseded by the DbgID/RSDS event.

            TraceEvent.TimeStamp internally is stored using a high resolution clock called the Query Performance Counter (QPC).
            This clock is INDEPENDENT of the system clock used by DateTime.   These two clocks are synchronized to within 2 msec at 
            session startup but they can drift from there (typically 2msec / min == 3 seconds / day).   Thus if you have long
            running real time session it becomes problematic to compare the timestamps with those in another session or something
            timestamped with the system clock.   SynchronizeClock will synchronize the TraceEvent.Timestamp clock with the system
            clock again.   If you do this right before you start another session, then the two sessions will be within 2 msec of
            each other, and their timestamps will correlate.     Doing it periodically (e.g. hourly), will keep things reasonably close.  
            
            TODO: we can achieve perfect synchronization by exposing the QPC tick sync point so we could read the sync point 
            from one session and set that exact sync point for another session.

            <summary>
            A caller callee view is a summation which centers around one 'focus' node which is represented by the CallerCalleeNode.
            This node has a caller and callee list, and these nodes (as well as the CallerCalleNode itself) represent the aggregation
            over the entire tree.
            
            AccumlateSamplesForNode is the routine that takes a part of a aggregated call tree (represented by 'treeNode' and adds
            in the statistics for that call tree into the CallerCalleeNode aggregations (and its caller and callee lists).  
            
            'recursionsCount' is the number of times the focus node name has occurred in the path from 'treeNode' to the root.   In 
            addition to setting the CallerCalleeNode aggregation, it also returns a 'weightedSummary' inclusive aggregation 
            FOR JUST treeNode (the CallerCalleNode is an aggregation over the entire call tree accumulated so far).  
            
            The key problem for this routine to avoid is double counting of inclusive samples in the face of recursive functions. 
            Thus all samples are weighted by the recursion count before being included in 'weightedSummaryRet (as well as in
            the CallerCalleeNode and its Callers and Callees).    
            
            An important optimization is the ability to NOT create (but rather reuse) CallTreeNodes when returning weightedSummaryRet.
            To accomplish this the weightedSummaryScaleRet is needed.  To get the correct numerical value for weightedSummaryRet, you 
            actually have to scale values by weightedSummaryScaleRet before use.   This allows us to represent weights of 0 (subtree has 
            no calls to the focus node), or cases where the subtree is completely uniform in its weighting (the subtree does not contain
            any additional focus nodes), by simply returning the tree node itself and scaling it by the recursion count).  
            
            isUniformRet is set to false if anyplace in 'treeNode' does not have the scaling factor weightedSummaryScaleRet.  This
            means the the caller cannot simply scale 'treeNode' by a weight to get weightedSummaryRet.

            AggregateCallTreeNode supports a multi-level caller-callee view.   
            
            It does this by allow you to take any 'focus' node (typically a byname node)
            and compute a tree of its callers and a tree of its callees.   You do this

            The AggregateCallTreeNode remembers if if is a caller or callee node and its
            'Callees' method returns the children (which may in fact be Callers). 
            
            What is nice about 'AggregateCallTreeNode is that it is lazy, and you only 
            form the part of the tree you actually explore.     A classic 'caller-callee'

            <summary>
            Samples have stacks (lists of frames, each frame contains a name) associated with them.  This interface allows you to get 
            at this information.  We don't use normal objects to represent these but rather give each stack (and frame) a unique
            (dense) index.   This has a number of advantages over using objects to represent the stack.
            
                * Indexes are very serialization friendly, and this data will be presisted.  Thus indexes are the natural form for data on disk. 
                * It allows the data to be read from the serialized format (disk) lazily in a very straightfoward fashion, keeping only the
                    hottest elements in memory.  
                * Users of this API can associate additional data with the call stacks or frames trivially and efficiently simply by
                    having an array indexed by the stack or frame index.   
                    
            So effectively a StackSourceStacks is simply a set of 'Get' methods that allow you to look up information given a Stack or
            frame index.

            <summary>
            A specialized hash table for interning.
            It loosely follows the implementation of <see cref="T:System.Collections.Generic.Dictionary`2"/> but with
            several key allowances for known usage patterns:
            1. We don't store the hashcode on each entry on the assumption that values can be compared
               as quickly as recomputing hash codes. The downside to that is that the hash codes must
               be recomputed whenever the map is resized, but that is very cheap.
            2. We supply a single <see cref="M:Microsoft.Diagnostics.Tracing.Stacks.StackSourceInterner.InternTable`1.Intern(`0)"/> method (instead of a TryGetValue
               followed by an Add) so that a hashcode computation is saved in the case of a "miss".
            3. We don't support removal. This means we don't need to keep track of a free list and neither
               do we need sentinel values. This also allows us to use all 32 bits of the hash-code (where
               <see cref="T:System.Collections.Generic.Dictionary`2"/> uses only 31 bits, reserving -1 to indicate a freed
               entry. The only sentinel value is in the <see cref="F:Microsoft.Diagnostics.Tracing.Stacks.StackSourceInterner.InternTable`1._buckets"/> array to indicate a free
               bucket.
            4. We return an index (of the interned item) to the caller which can be used for constant-time
               look-up in the table via <see cref="P:Microsoft.Diagnostics.Tracing.Stacks.StackSourceInterner.InternTable`1.Item(System.Int32)"/>.
            5. To free up memory, the caller can call <see cref="M:Microsoft.Diagnostics.Tracing.Stacks.StackSourceInterner.InternTable`1.DoneInterning"/>. The entries themselves
               are stored separately from the indexing parts of the table so that the latter can be dropped
               easily.

            TraceEventStackSource is an implementation of a StackSource for ETW information (TraceLog)
            It takes a TraceEvents (which is a list of TraceEvents you get get from a TraceLog) and 
            implements that StackSource protocol for them.  (thus any code needing a StackSource 
            can then work on it.  
            
            The key to the implementation is how StackSourceFrameIndex and StackSourceCallStackIndex 
            (part of the StackSource protocol) are mapped to the Indexes in TraceLog.   Here is
            the mapping.

            Like a TraceEventStackSource a MutableTraceEventStackSource allows you incorporate the stacks associated with
            a TraceEvent as a sample in the StackSource.   However in addition it allows you to create new frames for these
            stacks on the fly as well as add samples that did not exist in the original TraceEvent stream.   This gives you
            a lot of flexibility to add additional data to the original stream of TraceEvents.   
            
            Like TraceEventStackSource MutableTraceEventStackSource supports the GetFrameCodeAddress() method that  allows

            TraceEventSource is an abstract base class that represents the output of a ETW session (e.g. a ETL file

            the events, but contains methods for properties associated with the session
            like its start and end time, filename, and characteristics of the machine it was collected on.

            TraceEventParser Represents a class that knows how to decode particular set of events (typically
            all the events of a single ETW provider).  It is expected that subclasses of TraceEventParser 
            have a constructor that takes a TraceEventSource as an argument that 'attaches' th parser 
            to the TraceEventSource.  TraceEventParsers break into two groups.

            have died without cleaning up their filter data.

            The data model for an Event trace log (ETL) file is simply a stream of events.     More sophisticated 
            analysis typically needs a a richer data model then ETL files can provide, and this is the 
            motivation for the ETLX (Event Trace Log eXtended) file format.   In particular any 
            analysis that needs non-sequential access to the events or manipulates stack traces associated 
            with events needs the additional support that the ETLX format provides.   See the TraceEventProgrammers guide
            for more on the capabilities of ETLX.  
            <para>
            The TraceLog class is the programmatic representation of an ETLX file.   It represents the ETLX file as a whole.

            ETLX files are typically created from ETL files using the TraceLog.OpenOrCreate method or more explicitly

            From a TraceEventSession, create a real time TraceLog Event Source.   Like a ETWTraceEventSource a TraceLogEventSource

            the .Log Property) which lets you get at aggregated information (Processes, threads, images loaded, and perhaps most
            importantly TraceEvent.CallStack() will work.  Thus you can get real time stacks from events).

            and only windows 8 has a session that allows both kernel and user mode events simultaneously.   Thus this is most useful

             Conceptually a TraceCodeAddress represents a particular point of execution within a particular

             depending on whether the code is managed or not.
             <para>* For native code (or NGened code), it is represented as a virtual addresis along with the loaded native
             module that includes that address along with its load address.  A code address does NOT 
             know its process because they can be shared among all processes that load a particular module
             at a particular location.   These code addresses will not have methods associated with them
             unless symbols information (PDBS) are loaded for the module using the LookupSymbolsForModule.  
             </para>
             <para> * For JIT compiled managed code, the address in a process is eagerly resolved into a method, module

            Methods are so common in most traces, that having a .NET object (a TraceMethod) for
            each one is often too expensive.   As optimization, TraceLog also assigns a method index
            to every method and this index uniquely identifies the method in a very light weight fashion.
            <para>
            To be useful, however you need to be able to ask questions about a method index without creating
            a TraceMethod.   This is the primary purpose of a TraceMethods (accessible from TraceLog.CodeAddresses.Methods).   
            It has a set of 
            methods that take a MethodIndex and return properties of the method (like its name, and module file)

            <summary>
            ETL files typically contain a large number of 'bookkeeping' event for resolving names of files, or methods or to indicate information
            about processes that existed when the trace was started (DCStart and DCStop events).   By default these events are stripped from
            the ETLX file because their information has already been used to do the bookkeeping as part of the conversion
            <para> 
            However sometimes it is useful to keep these events (typically for debugging TraceEvent itself) and setting this
            property to true will cause every event in the ETL file to be copied as an event to the ETLX file.

            Sometimes ETL files are too big , and you just want to look at a fraction of it to speed things up
            (or to keep file size under control).  The MaxEventCount property allows that.   10M will produce a 3-4GB ETLX file.  
            1M is a good value to keep ETLX file size under control.  Note that that the conversion still scan the entire 
            original ETL file too look for bookkeeping events, however MaxEventCount events will be transfered to the ETLX 
            file as events.
