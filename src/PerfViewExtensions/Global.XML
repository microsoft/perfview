            <summary>
            If you wish to programatically get at events in the ETL file you typically will want 
            to use the etlFile.TraceLog.Events directly (they are more efficient).   This is what
            is done in the DemoEventSearch, DemoLoadLibrary, and DemoStartupReport cases. 
            
            However if you simply want to control the PerfView event viewer and open it, then using
            the etlFile.Events class is what you want since you can open the event viewer on it 
            easily.  
            
            In this demo, we open a viewer for just the process and image load events.

            This demonstrates how to use the CallTree view problematically.  
            This demo takes a set of DLL names, and then assigns all CPU time to whichever
            member of the set is hit first crawling from the IP to the top of the stack.
            
            The idea is that you want to 'blame' one of small set of DLLs, and you want
            to ignore all other dlls that are not in your set (e.g. OS dlls), and assign
            any time they had one in your set.

            This demo shows you how to create a StackSource (or a class Stacks from 'nothing').  
            
            Note that a useful alternative to this is to simply generate a file XML file which
            matches the format of a PerfVIew.XML file.   This XML file is just what you would
            expect (a list of frame definitions, which define stacks which define samples).  
            Thus you may wish to simply generate this XML directy and simple read that file
            with OpenPerfViewXmlFile
