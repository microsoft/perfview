// HOW PERFVIEW SUPPORTS USER EXTENSIONS
// 
// When you execute
// 
//     PerfView UserCommand Global.Demonstration arg1 arg2 arg3
//     
// PerfView will look for a DLL called 'PerfViewExtensions\Global.dll next to PerfView.exe
// It will then look for a type call 'Commands' and create an instance of it.    Then it looks 
// for a method within that type called 'Demonstration' It then passes the rest of the parameteters 
// of the command to that method.  
// 
// If the target method target is varags (its last argument is 'params string[]') then that is 
// also supported.   In this case Demonstration is varags, so I can pass any number of arguments to it. 
// 
// The extension named 'Global' is special in that if the user command has no '.' in his user
// command, the extension is assumed to be 'Global' extension.   Thus the command above could 
// be shorted to
// 
//     PerfView UserCommand Demonstration arg1 arg2 arg3 
/**********************************************************************************************/
// CREATING A NEW PERFVIEW EXTENSION
// 
// PerView has a speical command called CreateExtentionTemplate that make creating a new extension 
// very easy (assuming you have Visual Studio 2010 or later installed).   To make a new extension
// Simply invoke the command
//
//     PerfView CreateExtensionProject EXTENSION_NAME
// 
// This will create a directory 'PerfViewExtensions' next to the PerfView.exe file.  It will also 
//
//     Create PerfViewExtensions\EXTENSION_NAMESrc with a .csFile and template to get you started
//     Create/Update PerfViewExtentions\Extensions.SLN to include all extensions projects in the
//          PerfViewExtensions directory.  
//
// If EXTENSION_NAME is not given the extension name 'Global' is assumed 
// 
// Thus to get going you simply need to run 
//
//     PerfView CreateExtensionProject
// 
// And then open the PerfViewExtensions\Extensions.sln file that was created/updated.  
//
// This file comes with a 'Commands' class with a 'Demonstration' command in it.  Set a breakpoint
// and hit F5 to start debugging your first PerfView Extension.  
/**********************************************************************************************/
// EXPLORING THE PERFVIEW OBJECT MODEL
//
//     1) INTELLISENSE IS YOUR FRIEND!  Only the PerfViewExtensibility is open by default and this
//        is where the most important classes in PerfView's object model reside.  This means that
//        there is a good chance if you type some characters, you will find what you are looking for.
//     2) CommmandEnvironment is a good place to start.   This is the class that defines 'global'
//        methods.  If you select on the CommmandEnvironment below and hit F12, you can browse the
//        other global methods.  These methods will return other important types in the object model
//        (e.g. EtlFile, Events, Stacks).  
//     3) Understand classes in PerfViewExtensibility first.  You can use the object browser (Ctrl-W J)
//        and look under the PerfView.PerfViewExtensibility namespace.
//     4) Take a look at the example commands.  These use many of the important features (logging,
//        symbol lookup, html report) in context, which is quite helpeful.  
/**********************************************************************************************/
// TIPS AND TRICKS
//
//     1) LogFile.WriteLine messages surrounded by [] will also be displayed in the Status Line 
//        (of the main window)

        # event loaded until someone clicks on your view (rather then when someone clicked on the file)  
        #
        # The callback must take one string argument which is the name of the data file that is being opened.  Typically this 
        # callback adds additional views (children) to the file in the viewer.
