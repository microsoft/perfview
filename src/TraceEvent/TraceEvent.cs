// #Introduction 
// 
// Note that TraceEvent lives in a Nuget package.   See 
// http://blogs.msdn.com/b/vancem/archive/2014/03/15/walk-through-getting-started-with-etw-traceevent-nuget-samples-package.aspx
// and 
//  http://blogs.msdn.com/b/vancem/archive/2013/08/15/traceevent-etw-library-published-as-a-nuget-package.aspx
// 
// For more details.  In particular the second blog post will contain the TraceEventProgrammersGuide.docx, which has
// more background.
//
// Finally if you are interested in creating your own TraceEventParsers for your ETW provider, inside Microsoft you can access
// the TraceParserGen tool at http://toolbox/TraceParserGen.   There is also a copy available externally at http://1drv.ms/1Rxk2iD 
// in the TraceParserGen.zip file and the TraceParserGen.src.zip file.   
//
// The the heart of the ETW reader are two important classes.
// 
//     * TraceEventSource which is an abstract represents the stream of events as a whole. Thus it
//         has holds things like session start and stop times, number of lost events etc.
//         
//     * TraceEvent is a base class that represents an individual event payload. Because different
//         events have different fields, this is actually the base of a class hierarchy. TraceEvent
//         itself holds all properties that are common to all events (like TimeDateStamp, ProcessID,
//         ThreadID, etc). Subclasses then add properties that know how to parse that specific event
//         type.
//         
// However these two classes are not enough. ETW has a model where there can be many independent
// providers each of which contributed to the event stream. Since the number of providers is unknown,
// TraceEventSource can not know the details of decoding all possible events. Instead we introduce
// a class
// 
//    TraceEventParser
//  
// one for each provider. This class knows the details of taking a binary blob representing a event and
// turning it into a TraceEvent. Since each provider has different details of how to do this,
// TraceEventParser is actually just a base class and specific subclasses of TraceEventParser
// like KernelTraceEventParser or ClrTraceEventParser do the real work.
// 
// TraceEventParsers have a very ridged layout that closely parallels the data in the providers's ETW
// manifest (in fact there is a tool for creating TraceEventParser's from a ETW manifest). A
// TraceEventParser has a C# event (callback) for each different event the provider can generate. These
// events callbacks have an argument that is the specific subclass of TraceEvent that represents
// the payload for that event. This allows client code to 'subscribe' to events in a strongly typed way.
// For example:
// 
// * ETWTraceEventSource source = new ETWTraceEventSource("output.etl"); // open an ETL file
// * KernelTraceEventParser kernelEvents = new KernelTraceEventParser(source); // Attach Kernel Parser.
// *
// * // Subscribe to the ImageLoad event that the KernelTraceEventParser knows about.
// * kernelEvents.ImageLoad += delegate(ImageLoadTraceData data) {
//      * Console.WriteLine("Got Image Base {0} ModuleFile {1} ", data.BaseAddress, data.FileName);
// * };
// *
// * // Attach more parsers, and subscribe to more events.
// * source.Process(); // Read through the stream, calling all the callbacks in one pass.
// 
// In the example above, ETWTraceEventSource (a specific subclass of TraceEventSource that understand
// ETL files) is created by opening the 'output.etl' file. Then the KernelTraceEventParser is 'attached'
// to the source so that kernel events can be decoded. Finally a callback is registered with the
// KernelTraceEventParser, to call user code when the 'ImageLoad' event is found in the stream. The user
// code has access to an ImageLoadTraceData which is a subclass of TraceEvent and has properties
// like 'BaseAddress' and 'FileName' which are specific to that particular event. The user can subscribe
// to many such events (each having different event-specific data), and then finally call Process() which
// causes the source to enumerate the event stream, calling the appropriate callbacks.
// 
// This model has the important attribute that new TraceEventParsers (ETW providers), can be crated and
// used by user code WITHOUT changing the code associated with TraceEventSource. Unfortunately, it
// has a discoverability drawback. Given a TraceEventSource (like ETWTraceEventSource), it is difficult
// discover that you need classes like KernelTraceEventParser to do anything useful with the
// source. As a concession to discoverabilty, TraceEventSource provides properties ('Kernel' and CLR)
// for two 'well known' parsers. Thus the above example can be written
// 
// * ETWTraceEventSource source = new ETWTraceEventSource("output.etl"); // open an ETL file
// * source.Kernel.ImageLoad += delegate(ImageLoadTraceData data) {
//      * Console.WriteLine("Got Image Base {0} ModuleFile {1} ", data.BaseAddress, data.FileName);
// * };
// * source.Process(); // Read through the stream, calling all the callbacks in one pass.
// 
// To keep efficiently high, this basic decode in Process() does NOT allocate new event every time a
// callback is made. Instead TraceEvent passed to the callback is reused on later events, so
// clients must copy the data out if they need to persist it past the time the callback returns. The
// TraceEvent.Clone method can be used to form a copy of a TraceEvent that will not be reused
// by the TraceEventSource.
// 
// Another important attribute of the system is that decoding of the fields of TraceEvent is done
// lazily. For example ImageLoadTraceData does not actually contain fields for things like
// 'BaseAddress' or 'FileName', but simply a pointer to the raw bits from the file. It is only when a
// property like ImageLoadTraceData.FileName it invoked that the raw bits are actually read converted
// to a string. The rationale for this approach is that it is common that substantial parts of an
// event's payload may be ignored by any particular client. A consequence of this approach is that for
// properties that do non-trivial work (like create a string from the raw data) it is better not to call
// the property multiple times (instead cache it locally in a local variable).
// 
// Supporting Sources that don't implement a callback model
// 
// In the previous example ETWTraceEventSource supported the subscription model where the client
// registers a set of callbacks and then calls Process() to cause the callbacks to happen. This model
// is very efficient and allows a lot of logically distinct processing to be done in 'one pass'. However
// we also want to support sources that do not wish to support the callback model (opting instead for a
// iteration model). To support this TraceEventSource that knows how to do this dispatch (as well
// as the Process()) method), is actually put in a subclass of TraceEventSource called
// TraceEventDispatcher. Those sources that support the subscription model inherit from
// TraceEventSource, and those that do not inherit directly from TraceEventSource.
// 
// The Protocol between TraceEventParser and TraceEventSource
// 
// What is common among all TraceEventSources (even if they do not support callbacks), is that parsers
// need to be registered with the source so that the source can decode the events. This is the purpose
// of the TraceEventSource.RegisterParser and TraceEventSource.RegisterEventTemplate methods.
// The expectation is that when a subclass of TraceEventParser is constructed, it will be passed a
// TraceEventSource. The parser should call the RegisterParser method, so that the source knows
// about this new parser. Also any time a user subscribes to a particular event in the parser, the
// source needs to know about so that its (shared) event dispatch table can be updated this is what
// RegisterEventTemplate is for.
// 
// * See also
//     * code:ETWTraceEventSource a trace event source for a .ETL file or a 'real time' ETW stream.
//     * code:ETLXTraceEventSource a trace event source for a ETLX file (post-processes ETL file).
//     * code:TraceEventParser is the base class for all event parsers for TraceEvents.
//     * code:TraceEventDispatcher contains logic for dispatching events in the callback model
//         * The heart of the callback logic is code:TraceEventDispatcher.Dispatch
