/* README FIRST */
// This program is a simple demo that demonstrates how to make EVentSources log to a file as
// as well as how to read that file and parse the resulting events.   
// 
// The basic flow of the program is
//   Generating of the ETL file:
//     * Create a 'file' TraceEventSession.  This lets you control what events you wish to collect, and 
//          tells the session where to put the file.  
//     * Enable the ETW providers of interest (in this case Microsoft-Demos-SimpleMonitor) 
//     * Kick off EventGenerator to generate some Microsoft-Demos-SimpleMonitor events (normally in another process).  
//     * Wait for the generate to generate some events (12 seconds)
//     * End the session 
//
//   Parsing of the ETL file 
//     * Create an ETWTraceEventSource which gets its data from the data file.   A TraceEventSource 
//           represents the stream of events in the file.  
//     * Connect a TraceEventParser to the source.    Parsers know how to interpret events from particular 
//          ETW providers.  In this case we care about EventSource events and the DynamicTraceEventParser
//          is the parser that cares about it. 
//     * Attach callbacks to the Parser for the events you are interested in.  We use the 'All' C# event 
//          for this.  
//     * Call ETWTraceEventSource.Process() which will loop through all events in the file.  It can
//          be stopped early by calling ETWTraceEventSource.StopProcessing().  
//     * Your processing happens in the callbacks
//     * ETWTraceEventSource.Process() returns.  
//     * Dispose the ETWTraceEventSource, which closes the files and cleans up resources.
