/* README FIRST */
// This program is a simple demo that demonstrates both the EventSource to generate ETL events as 
// well as using the ETWTraceEventSource class to read the resulting ETW events in real time.   
//
// The basic flow of the program is
//     * Create a 'real time' TraceEventSession.  This lets you control what events you wish to collect
//     * Connect a ETWTraceEventSource for the session using the 'Source' property.   A TraceEventSource 
//           represents the stream of events coming from the session.  
//     * Connect a TraceEventParser to the source.    Parsers know how to interpret events from particular 
//          ETW providers.  In this case we care about EVentSource events and the DynamicTraceEventParser
//          is the parser that cares about it.  
//     * Attach callbacks to the Parser for the events you are interested in.  We use the 'All' C# event 
//          for this.  
//     * Enable the ETW providers of interest (in this case Microsoft-Demos-SimpleMonitor) 
//     * Kick off EventGenerator to generate some Microsoft-Demos-SimpleMonitor events (normally in another process).  
//     * Call the ETWTraceEventSource.Process() method, which waits for events and sends them to the callbacks. 
//     * At this point callbacks get called when the events come in.  
//     
// After 'Process()' is called, it will return if
//     * ETWTraceEventSource.StopProcessing() is called.
//     * The TraceEventSession.Dispose() is called.

            // To listen to ETW events you need a session, which allows you to control which events will be produced
