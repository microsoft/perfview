##Tools Needed: Get the Download management Studio application 

  * http://downloadservice/managementconsole/

## Open download management studio, you should see "PerfView 1.0" under the list of all owned downloads.
    1. The Details node under this tree is for updating the content of the downloads page.
    2. The releases node is for updating the file which is available on the downloads page.


## Updating the details page 

    1. Update the long description (best practice is to add a few bullets every time you upload the download).
    2. Click save
    3. Right click on English - United States -> Publish Download Detail.  I tend to do this step after I have published the file.

##Updating the file 

    1. Click on "en-us", in the right hand pane there is a general tab and a files tab.
    2. In the general tab: make sure there are three signers, where two of the signers must have a manager -> employee relationship (Lorenzo -> BrianRob would suffice ;))  Lee Coward can also be a signer but from what I can tell it does not help. 
    3. In the files tab, right click on PerfView.zip and select "Delete Selected Files"
    4. Click Add Files -> browse to the PerfView.Zip you want to upload.
    5. Click the 'save' icon on the toolbar
    6. From the menu bar, Click Download -> Activate to prepare the file to be updated. This will send out a request for everyone to sign off on the download, and it will take ~15 minutes for the process to run its course.
    7. Once the download is ready to publish, you can click Download -> Publish. This should send the updated file out to the web fairly quickly.
